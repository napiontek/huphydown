<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of 
metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence them (add # before each line). 

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

The acknowledgements, preface, dedication, and abstract are added into the PDF
version automatically by inputting them in the YAML at the top of this file.
Alternatively, you can put that content in files like 00--prelim.Rmd and
00-abstract.Rmd like done below.
